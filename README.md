##Special Thanks
I would like to thank my instructors, classmates and my wife for all the help and support.
This was my first official project at General Assembly Web Development Immersive Program.

##OOTD is an acronym for Outfit Of The Day.
Project was to make an API using Node and Express. The Idea is to grab images from Instragram API
then give users the ability to save their favorite Outfits by a few different
catorgories. The User can save Outfits, Tops, Legs, Shoes and Pieces.

I had a lot of fun making this project and got to use the following tools.
